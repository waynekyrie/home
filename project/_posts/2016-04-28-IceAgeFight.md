## Overview
This was a course project for [15112](https://www.kosbie.net/cmu/spring-16/15-112/schedule.html). It was the final big project for the course and it was a game written in Python.

## Idea
The game was inspired by the Ice Age movie. Basically, there are two characters, one to attack and one to defense. The player who attacks can collect weapons and use a catapult to launch it to the fortress. Different weapons have different lethality. And there is weather condition, so the player needs to adjust the way of launching according to the weather. The player who defenses needs to enhance the fortress to withstand the attack. The game also has different level of difficulties, and can be played in single or multi-players mode.
