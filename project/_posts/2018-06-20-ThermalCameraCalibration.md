This was a research project that I did during the internship in the [AirLab](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/robotics-groups/air-lab/) led by [Prof. Sebastian Scherer](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/ri-faculty/sebastian-scherer/).

## Overview
Due to the manufacturing process, cameras are not made perfectly fitting the theoretical model. The mismatched model leads to deviation in the transformation map between 3D object points to 2D image points. It is required to correct this mismatched model in order to use the camera projection model. Therefore, geometric calibration is an important step that directly impacts the following algorithms. Calibrating a regular visual camera is a common task now and there exist many good tools to accomplish that. However, calibrating a thermal camera is much more difficult. Since the features are blurred on thermal images, existing methods of calibration visual cameras can not be directly applied to thermal cameras.
