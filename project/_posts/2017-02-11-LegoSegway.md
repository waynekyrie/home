## Overview
This was a course project for [16311](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs.cmu.edu/academic/class/16311/www/s17/index.html). There were many projects throughout the semester, 
and each one lasted for around one week. The goal for this one was to build a segway robot that could balance itself.

## Approach
The robot was built using lego pieces. It has two light sensors, one on each side. The basic idea was to use the measurement value to approximate the distance from the sensor to ground. 
And we use PID control to balance the sensor measurements, and thus, balance the robot.

This is a short video for testing. The video only shows for a few seconds, but the best record we got was more than 10 min.
