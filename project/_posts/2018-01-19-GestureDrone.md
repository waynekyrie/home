This was a project for the CMU Build18 hackathon in 2018. The basic idea was to use simple, intuitive hand gestures to control a drone. We built a drone from scratch and modified the onboard controller.

When we were flying with the original controller, it was difficult to stably control the drone with the RC. So due to safety concerns, we didn't fly using gesture control. But the video can still show the drone changing its attitude with the given gesture.
