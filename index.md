I am a graduate student in the [Robotics Institute](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/) at Carnegie Mellon University advised by [Prof. Changliu Liu](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/ri-faculty/changliu-liu/). I am working in the [Intelligent Control Lab]() as a graduate research assistant. My research focuses on adaptive systems, safe human-robot collaboration, and machine perception.
