I am a graduate student in the [Robotics Institute](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/) at Carnegie Mellon University advised by [Prof. Changliu Liu](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/ri-faculty/changliu-liu/). I am working in the [Intelligent Control Lab](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/robotics-groups/intelligent-control-lab/) as a graduate research assistant. My research focuses on adaptive systems, safe human-robot collaboration, and robot perception.

I received my Bachelorâ€™s degree in [Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://www.ece.cmu.edu/) with a minor in Robotics at Carnegie Mellon University.
